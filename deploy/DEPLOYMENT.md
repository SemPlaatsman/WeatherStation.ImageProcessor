# Deployment Status and Documentation

## Current Status
The Weather Station Image Processor application is currently fully functional locally but not deployed to Azure. This is due to temporary Azure subscription access limitations. The application is ready for deployment with all necessary infrastructure-as-code and deployment scripts prepared.

## Infrastructure Setup
All required Azure infrastructure has been defined using Bicep templates (`main.bicep`), which include:
- Azure Function App (.NET 8.0 Isolated worker model)
- Storage Account with:
  - Two queues for job processing
  - Table storage for job status tracking
  - Blob storage for image storage
- Application Insights for monitoring

## Deployment Prerequisites
The following files are prepared and ready in this directory:
- `main.bicep`: Infrastructure as code definition
- `parameters.json`: Configuration parameters for the deployment
- `deploy.ps1`: PowerShell deployment script

## Local Development
The application can be run locally using:
1. Azure Storage Emulator (Azurite) for storage services
2. Local settings configured in `local.settings.json`
3. .NET 8.0 SDK

## Future Deployment Steps
Once Azure subscription access is restored:

1. Ensure the following prerequisites are met:
   - Active Azure subscription
   - Azure CLI installed
   - PowerShell 7.0 or later
   - Bicep CLI tools

2. Run the deployment script:
   ```powershell
   ./deploy.ps1 -ResourceGroupName "your-resource-group" -Location "westeurope" -UnsplashAccessKey "your-unsplash-key"
   ```

3. Verify the deployment by:
   - Testing the HTTP endpoints using the provided `req.http` file
   - Checking Application Insights for telemetry
   - Verifying queue processing functionality

## Must-Have Requirements Status
Current status of all must-have requirements:
- ✅ Public API endpoints using HttpTrigger
- ✅ Background processing using QueueTrigger
- ✅ Blob Storage implementation for image storage
- ✅ Buienradar API integration
- ✅ Unsplash API integration
- ✅ Status endpoint implementation
- ✅ HTTP files for API documentation
- ✅ Bicep template created
- ✅ Multiple queues for job processing
- ❌ Azure deployment (prepared but pending subscription access)
- ❌ Azure DevOps repository setup and access (blocked by subscription limitations)

## Blocked Requirements
The following requirements cannot be fulfilled due to Azure subscription limitations:

1. Azure Deployment
   - All infrastructure code and deployment scripts are prepared
   - Deployment is blocked by subscription access

2. Azure DevOps Repository Setup
   - Organization creation requires an active Azure subscription
   - Reviewer access cannot be granted without organization access
   - Code remains available in GitHub repository

## Next Steps
Once Azure subscription access is restored:
1. Create Azure DevOps organization and project
2. Import code from GitHub to Azure DevOps
3. Grant reviewer access following provided instructions:
   - Add reviewer as Visual Studio subscriber
   - Enable External Guest Access
   - Add reviewer as project administrator
4. Execute the prepared deployment scripts
5. Verify all functionality in the cloud environment
6. Update documentation with actual endpoint URLs

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The application's architecture and implementation are complete and verified in the local development environment. The outstanding requirements are blocked by Azure subscription access limitations. All necessary code, infrastructure definitions, and deployment scripts are prepared for immediate deployment once access is restored.
